<h1>Get That App</h1>


<strong>The Get That App is a visual aide to saving for purchases made through Amazon.</strong>

<h6>It is built using React, and uses Express, Mongoose, Cheerio, Axios, Bootstrap 4, Auth0, Animejs, Babel & Webpack.</h6>

<p>The Get That App allows a user to set a budget and then browse Amazons website based
on a keyword search. Once the user has found an item they like, they are able to select from 
1 of 3 timeframes and add their future purchase to a wishlist. From there our app will calculate
all items being saved over a specific timeframe and return the overall percentage of their budget being
used and the total sum of what is saved. Users can add and remove items or update their budget at anytime
and with the power of react see the adjusted calculations without submission or refreshing.</p>
